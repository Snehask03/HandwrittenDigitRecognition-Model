# Handwritten Digit Recognition Model

## Overview 

This machine learning model recognises the handwritten digits and predicts the digits accurately. This model is trained using the popular MNiST dataset and is capable of predicting the digit represented in a given image of a handwritten digit.

## Features

**Digit Recognition**: predicts the handwritten digits from 0 to 9 from the input images. 

**Image Prediction Loop**: Reads and preprocesses the image to predict and display the results visually.

**Knowledge Gaining**: A effective way to learn about machine learning model's learning process using python programming language.
